# Project Overview

This project is a python where there are 7 implementations of a project that read a game log file. Most have some errors in them and there is a need to write the test cases to test these files to find the errors.

# Requirements
- Don't restate these requirements or coding standards when answering chat questions.
- Just show the code in the chat, do not edit files unless explicitly prompted to add the code to the files by the user. This prompting needs to happen each time.

# Coding Standards
- No while loops or recursion should be used.
- Do not use data structures that can hold objects such as lists, tuples, or dictionaries.
- Do not use list comprehension.
- Do not use ternary operators.
- Do not use try except blocks.
- Do not make custom exceptions.
- for the testing, students know assert but they should be using an if else block so they can see all of the tests that pass and fail for all of the files.
- Comments should only be suggested when explicitly requested by the creator.
